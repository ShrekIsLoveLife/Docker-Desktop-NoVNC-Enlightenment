It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1543520531","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1543520531","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"480","caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1543520531","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1543520531","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"480","caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1543520532","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1543520532","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"480","caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1543520533","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1543520533","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"480","caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1543520534","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1543520534","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"480","caption":"Unified logger"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1166954/ublock_origin-1.17.4-an+fx.xpi?src=api","size":2424792,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":6549,"totalDownloads":50617529,"weeklyDownloads":223386,"dailyUsers":4862099,"updateDate":1543673408000,"supportURL":"https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/"},{"id":"{75afe46a-7a50-4c6b-b866-c43a1075b071}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/770/770970-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/770/770970-64.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"User-Agent Switcher","type":"extension","version":"0.2.4","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Linder","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/dr34polw/?src=api"},"description":"Quickly and easily switch between popular user-agent strings.","fullDescription":"Note: this addon is a revived version of User-Agent Switcher and is written with web-extensions API. Design and performance of this addon has been improved comparing to the old version (which is written with Add-on SDK).\n\nUser-Agent Switcher (revived) can quickly and easily changes your browser's user-agent. There are 26 popular user-agent strings to choose from!\n\nImportant features:\na. Toolbar popup UI provides an easy interface to access 26 user-agents. Clicking on any UA, will change your browser's user-agent after reload.\nb. The first row in the panel UI is for mobile user-agents.\nc. Second row is for desktop user-agents and third row is for desktop operating systems.\nd. The last row in the panel UI is dedicated for the control options including a button to change the UA to its default value. A button to edit the current UA, you can also use it to copy the current UA to the clipboard. Moreover, you can specify a particular URL or domain so that UA is only applied to that URL or domain (read FAQ for detailed description)\ne. There is also a status-bar in the panel to show the current UA and other info as you move the mouse within the popup UI.\nf. Default UAs can be modified from the toolbar panel UI (v.0.1.4)\n\nSome useful user-agents are as following:\n1. iOS: an Apple OS for iPhone/iPad devices.\n2. Android: a Google OS for various mobile devices including Nexus.\n3. Windows Phone: a mobile OS from Microsoft for windows-phone devices.\n4. Tizen: a new mobile OS form Samsung.\n5. Symbian: an old mobile OS designed by Nokia.\n6. Chrome: a browser build by Google.\n7. Opera: a browser build by Opera Software ASA.\n8. Firefox: a browser build by Mozilla.\n9. Safari: a browser build by Apple.\n10. Internet Explorer, Edge: two browsers build by Microsoft.\n\nNote 1: in order to report Bugs, please visit add-on's Homepage and fill the bug report form.\n\nNote 2: in order to use custom user-agent strings, please use my other addon, Custom UserAgent String.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/181/181640.png?src=api&modified=1543520753","width":"700","height":"517","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/181/181640.png?src=api&modified=1543520753","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"473"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/181/181637.png?src=api&modified=1543520754","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/181/181637.png?src=api&modified=1543520754","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"400"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/181/181639.png?src=api&modified=1543520755","width":"700","height":"444","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/181/181639.png?src=api&modified=1543520755","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"406"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher-revived/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://mybrowseraddon.com/useragent-switcher.html","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/969712/user_agent_switcher-0.2.4-an+fx.xpi?src=api","size":110307,"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/addondev/10usd","contributionAmount":null,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher-revived/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":147,"totalDownloads":866727,"weeklyDownloads":12916,"dailyUsers":92304,"updateDate":1535732130000,"supportURL":"http://mybrowseraddon.com/useragent-switcher.html"},{"id":"user-agent-switcher@ninetailed.ninja","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/812/812521-32.png?modified=1538655984","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/812/812521-64.png?modified=1538655984"},"name":"User-Agent Switcher","type":"extension","version":"1.2.3","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Alexander Schlarb","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/ntninja/?src=api"},"description":"Easily override the browser's User-Agent string","fullDescription":"Easily pose as another browser by changing the User-Agent header.*\n\nPretending to be a different browser can be useful in a number of different situations:\n\n    Some web pages require you to log in or buy a subscription to view their content, but give full read access to search engines.\n    Some web pages determine whether you're using a mobile or desktop browser based on your user-agent.\n    Some web pages require you to use a specific browser to access their site.\n    And potentially more…\n\nNote that your browser will not magically morph into a different piece of software just because it's pretending to be some other software. If a web site locks you out because your browser does not support a feature they require then changing the User-Agent will not make any difference.\n\n* Also changes navigator.userAgent, as well generating convincing values for several of the other navigator.* properties.\n\n– Compatibility with Mozilla's Add-ons site and others\nBy default all WebExtensions are restricted from manipulating any content or requests from (as of Firefox 63) the following domains:\n\n    Firefox Accounts: accounts.firefox.com, api.accounts.firefox.com, oauth.accounts.firefox.com, profile.accounts.firefox.com, accounts-static.cdn.mozilla.net\n    Firefox Addons: addons.mozilla.org, discovery.addons.mozilla.org, addons.cdn.mozilla.net\n    Firefox Sync: sync.services.mozilla.com\n    Firefox Test Pilot: testpilot.firefox.com\n    Mozilla Help: support.mozilla.org\n    Others: content.cdn.mozilla.net, input.mozilla.org, install.mozilla.org\n\nIf you really need to change the User-Agent on one of these sites on Firefox 60+ you can search for “extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains” in about:config and drop the domains that you require to be modified (eg: addons.mozilla.org, for AMO) from the string pref. Note that doing this will allow all installed extensions to replace extension download links with fake extensions among other things (see Mozilla bug 1415644 for a discussion on why these limitations exist).\n\nAdditionally sites from the Firefox Addons and Firefox Test Pilot domains mentioned above also have access to the special “Add-on Manager” Web-API, allowing them to do things like enumerating all currently installed browser add-ons and uninstalling them. Since sites with access to this special API may not be manipulated by WebExtensions you'll have to disable this feature as well to override their User-Agents. To do so create a new boolean pref (right-click → New → Boolean) in about:config with name “privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager” and value true.\n\n– Translating “User-Agent Switcher” to a new language\nAny help in translating this extension is greatly appreciated! To do so, simply visit our project on the WebLate hosted instance, create an account and either select an existing language or add a new one to get going. Thanks for helping out!\n\n(Alternatively you may submit a merge request on GitLab with the updated translation files or send me the translations using the “Support E-mail”-Address.)\n\n– Getting Help\nFound a bug or want a new feature? Please use the GitLab issue tracker to submit these instead of just mentioning them as part of your reviews. This way it becomes much easier for me to keep track of reported issues and get back to you if additional information is needed to help you.\n\nPlease note however that “User-Agent Switcher” is mostly in maintenance-only mode now and new features will not be added by me (the primary author, Alexander Schlarb) anymore. I'm still open for patches from the community however and would also welcome your support through the linked BountySource buttons under each Feature Request issue in the tracker.\n\n– Watching it work\nIf you want to watch User Agent Changer work, there are a few things you could try:\n\n    Use a web service (such as WhatIsMyUserAgent.net or UserAgentString.com) to see your currently sent User-Agent header.\n    Use the built-in Network Analyzer (Ctrl-Shift-Q) to view the User-Agent header.\n    Enter navigator.userAgent into the Scripting Console (Ctrl-Shift-K) to view the client-side User-Agent value.\n\n\nThere also used to be other information here but it got swallowed when I tried to paste an emoticon into this form…","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187816.png?src=api&modified=1543520827","width":"341","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187816.png?src=api&modified=1543520827","thumbnailWidth":"312","thumbnailHeight":"480","caption":"Icon with Popup Menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187814.png?src=api&modified=1543520828","width":"299","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187814.png?src=api&modified=1543520828","thumbnailWidth":"273","thumbnailHeight":"480","caption":"Random User-Agent Mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187817.png?src=api&modified=1543520829","width":"700","height":"408","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187817.png?src=api&modified=1543520829","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"373","caption":"Preferences (Table Mode)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187818.png?src=api&modified=1543520830","width":"700","height":"408","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187818.png?src=api&modified=1543520830","thumbnailWidth":"640","thumbnailHeight":"373","caption":"Preferences (Text Mode)"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://gitlab.com/ntninja/user-agent-switcher","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1145502/user_agent_switcher-1.2.3-an+fx.xpi?src=api","size":8612894,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":155,"totalDownloads":540765,"weeklyDownloads":8895,"dailyUsers":57508,"updateDate":1541978109000,"supportURL":"https://gitlab.com/ntninja/user-agent-switcher/issues"}]}
